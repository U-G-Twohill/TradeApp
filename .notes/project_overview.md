# Project Overview: Tradespeople Task Manager

## Goal
Build a personal project management application designed specifically for tradespeople. The app will help users track and update job tasks efficiently. In later phases, the application will enable:
- **Collaboration:** Allowing users (tradespeople, subcontractors, and project managers) to connect and delegate tasks.
- **Rating System:** An optional rating mechanism similar to apps like Uber to provide performance feedback.
- **Client Integration:** Future functionality to include clients in the process for enhanced communication and transparency.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** Cross-platform UI for Android, iOS, and Web (using technologies like React Native or Flutter).
- **Backend:** RESTful API or GraphQL server managing tasks, user profiles, and real-time updates.
- **Database:** A cloud-based solution (SQL or NoSQL) for storing tasks, user data, and ratings.
- **Authentication:** Secure user account management with support for social logins.
- **Notification System:** Real-time alerts for task updates and delegation.

## Key Features
- **Task Management:** Create, update, and track tasks on the job.
- **User Profiles:** Detailed profiles for tradespeople with ratings and history.
- **Delegation & Collaboration:** Connect users for task assignment and collaborative work.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Immediate feedback and notifications for changes in task status.
- **Scalability:** A modular design that allows for future expansion into client collaboration and other features.

## Sample User Journey
1. **Onboarding:** A tradesperson signs up and sets up their profile.
2. **Task Creation:** They create a new job and list all relevant tasks.
3. **Task Management:** Tasks are updated in real-time as work progresses.
4. **Collaboration:** As the project evolves, the user invites subcontractors and peers to help manage specific tasks.
5. **Feedback:** Upon completion, users rate each other's performance, fostering a transparent, merit-based work environment.
