# Project Progress Notes

## Initial Setup Phase (Date: 18/02/2025 10:27am)

### Completed Infrastructure
1. **Version Control & CI/CD**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Configured GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up linting, testing, and build pipelines

2. **Backend Foundation**
   - Established Node.js/Express project structure with TypeScript
   - Implemented logging system using Winston
   - Set up error handling middleware
   - Created health check endpoint
   - Configured ESLint and Prettier

3. **Database Design**
   - Designed initial database schema
   - Set up TypeORM configuration
   - Created entity models:
     - User entity with role-based structure
     - Task entity with relationship mappings
   - Prepared initial database migration

### Technical Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: Node.js with Express
   - Language: TypeScript
   - ORM: TypeORM
   - Database: PostgreSQL
   - Logging: Winston
   - API Security: Helmet, CORS

2. **Code Organization**
   - Implemented modular structure
   - Separated concerns (routes, middleware, entities)
   - Set up type-safe development environment

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Priority**
   - Set up local PostgreSQL database
   - Run and verify initial migrations
   - Implement authentication system

2. **Upcoming Tasks**
   - User authentication implementation
   - Core API routes development
   - Frontend project setup (Mobile & Web)

### Technical Debt / Considerations
1. **Security**
   - Need to implement proper authentication
   - Password hashing strategy to be determined
   - JWT implementation pending

2. **Database**
   - Need to create seed data for development
   - Consider adding database indexing strategy
   - Plan for database backup strategy

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests need to be implemented
   - Integration tests to be set up
   - API testing strategy to be defined

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Database Schema**
   - Using UUID for primary keys
   - Implemented soft deletion pattern
   - Created relationship between Users and Tasks
   - Added role-based user system

2. **API Design**
   - RESTful architecture
   - Versioned API structure (/api/...)
   - Standardized error handling
   - Logging for debugging and monitoring

### Open Questions
1. Should we implement real-time updates for task status changes?
2. What should be the strategy for handling offline capabilities in mobile app?
3. How should we implement the rating system for users?
