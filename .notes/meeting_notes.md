# Project Progress Notes

## Backend API Completion Phase (Date: 18/02/2025 09:11pm)

### Completed Features
1. **Job Management System**
   - Implemented complete CRUD operations for jobs
   - Added role-based job participation system
   - Successfully tested all job endpoints
   - Implemented proper error handling and authorization

2. **Task Management System**
   - Implemented complete CRUD operations for tasks
   - Tasks are properly linked to jobs
   - Role-based task management permissions
   - Successfully tested all task endpoints

3. **Core Architecture Achievements**
   - Established proper relationship between Users, Jobs, and Tasks
   - Implemented role-based access control for all operations
   - Successfully tested all relationships and permissions
   - Completed basic backend API structure

### Technical Considerations
1. **Security**
   - Need to implement input validation
   - Consider adding rate limiting
   - Consider implementing refresh tokens
   - Review authorization rules for edge cases

2. **Performance**
   - Consider adding caching for frequently accessed data
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Plan for scaling considerations

3. **Next Steps**
   - Implement API enhancements (validation, documentation, etc.)
   - Plan WebSocket integration for real-time updates
   - Prepare for frontend development

### Open Questions
1. Should we implement WebSocket first or after basic frontend setup?
2. Do we need to implement batch operations for tasks?
3. Should we add a notification system for task/job updates?


Initial Setup Phase (Date: 18/02/2025 11:44am)

### Completed Infrastructure
1. **Version Control & CI/CD**
   - Initialized Git repository
   - Configured GitHub Actions workflow
   - Set up linting, testing, and build pipelines

2. **Backend Foundation**
   - Established Node.js/Express project structure with TypeScript
   - Implemented logging system using Winston
   - Set up error handling middleware
   - Created health check endpoint
   - Configured ESLint and Prettier

3. **Database Design**
   - Designed initial database schema
   - Set up TypeORM configuration
   - Created entity models:
     - User entity with role-based structure
     - Task entity with relationship mappings
   - Prepared initial database migration
   - Successfully ran and tested migrations

4. **Authentication System**
   - Implemented JWT-based authentication
   - Created registration and login endpoints
   - Added password hashing with bcrypt
   - Implemented role-based authorization
   - Successfully tested all auth endpoints

5. **User Management API**
   - Implemented CRUD operations for users
   - Added role-based access control
   - Created user service layer
   - Successfully tested all user endpoints
   - Implemented security measures:
     - Password hashing
     - Protected routes
     - Role-based permissions

### Technical Decisions
1. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: Node.js with Express
   - Language: TypeScript
   - ORM: TypeORM
   - Database: PostgreSQL
   - Logging: Winston
   - API Security: Helmet, CORS
   - Authentication: JWT

2. **Code Organization**
   - Implemented modular structure
   - Separated concerns (routes, middleware, entities, services)
   - Set up type-safe development environment

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Priority**
   - Implement task management endpoints
   - Add input validation
   - Create API documentation

2. **Upcoming Tasks**
   - Frontend project setup (Mobile & Web)
   - Additional API features
   - Testing suite implementation

### Technical Debt / Considerations
1. **Security**
   - ✓ Implemented proper authentication
   - ✓ Password hashing implemented
   - ✓ JWT implementation complete
   - Consider adding refresh tokens
   - Consider rate limiting

2. **Database**
   - ✓ Basic schema implemented
   - Need to create seed data for development
   - Consider adding database indexing strategy
   - Plan for database backup strategy

3. **Testing**
   - Need to implement unit tests
   - Need to set up integration tests
   - API testing strategy to be defined

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Database Schema**
   - Using UUID for primary keys
   - Implemented soft deletion pattern
   - Created relationship between Users and Tasks
   - Added role-based user system

2. **API Design**
   - RESTful architecture
   - Versioned API structure (/api/...)
   - Standardized error handling
   - Logging for debugging and monitoring
   - Role-based access control

### Open Questions
1. Should we implement real-time updates for task status changes?
2. What should be the strategy for handling offline capabilities in mobile app?
3. How should we implement the rating system for users?
4. Should we add refresh tokens to the authentication system?
5. Do we need to implement rate limiting for the API?
